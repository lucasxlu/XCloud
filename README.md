# XCloud (EXtensive Cloud)
## Introduction
__XCloud__ is an open-source AI platform which provides common AI services (computer vision, NLP, data mining and etc.) with RESTful APIs. It allows you to serve your machine learning models with few lines of code. The platform is developed and maintained by [@LucasXU](https://github.com/lucasxlu) based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

The codes of building RESTful APIs are listed in [cv](./cv)/[nlp](./nlp)/[dm](./dm)/data module, [research branch](./research) holds the training/testing scripts and several research idea prototype implementations.

## Deployment
### Basic Environment Preparation
1. create a virtual enviroment named ```pyWeb``` follow [this tutorial](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/0014316089557264a6b348958f449949df42a6d3a2e542c000/001432712108300322c61f256c74803b43bfd65c6f8d0d0000)
2. install [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/install/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
3. install all dependent libraries: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. activate Python Web environment: ```source ~/pyWeb/bin/activate pyWeb```
5. start django server: 
    - test with Django built-in server:
    ```python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001```
    
    - start with gunicorn:
    ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 nohup gunicorn BCloud.wsgi -b YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8008 --timeout=500```
6. open your browser and visit welcome page: ```YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001/index```


### TensorRT Preparation
In order to construct a more efficient inference engine, it is highly recommended to use [TensorRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-archived/tensorrt-515/tensorrt-install-guide/index.html). With the help of [TensorRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-archived/tensorrt-515/tensorrt-install-guide/index.html), we are able to achieve **147.23** FPS (DenseNet169 as backbone) on 2080TI GPU without performance drop, which is significantly faster than its counterpart PyTorch model (29.45 FPS).

The installation is listed as follows:  
1. download installation package from NVIDIA official websites. I use ``.tar.gz`` in this project
2. add nvcc to you PATH: ``export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc:$PATH``
3. install pyCUDA: ``pip3 install 'pycuda>=2017.1.1'``
4. unzip ``.tar.gz`` file, and modify your environment by adding: ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/lucasxu/Software/TensorRT-5.1.5.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
5. install TensorRT Python wheel: ``pip3 install ~/Software/TensorRT-5.1.5.0/python/tensorrt-5.1.5.0-cp37-none-linux_x86_64.whl``
6. install [torch2trt](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/torch2trt.git)
7. then you can use [model_converter.py](https://github.com/lucasxlu/XCloud/blob/master/cv/model_converter.py) to convert a PyTorch model to TensorRT model


### ONNX & ONNX-Runtime Preparation
[ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime.git) is a performance-focused engine for [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) models, which inferences efficiently across multiple platforms and hardware (Windows, Linux, and Mac and on both CPUs and GPUs). We also provide a easy-to-use script [model_converter.py](https://github.com/lucasxlu/XCloud/blob/master/cv/model_converter.py) to allow you to easily convert a PyTorch model to ONNX model with ONNX-Runtime inference engine. 

Before use [model_converter.py](https://github.com/lucasxlu/XCloud/blob/master/cv/model_converter.py), make sure you have installed ``PyTorch, ONNX, and ONNX-Runtime``. If not, just try:
```python
pip3 install onnx onnxruntime-gpu
```

| Inference Engine | FPS |
| :---: | :---: |
| PyTorch | 29.45 |
| TensorRT | 147.23 |
| ONNX (CPU) | 6.93 |
| ONNX (GPU) | 68.42 |


### Upgrade Django Built-in Server
As suggested in [Django doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#runserver-port-or-address-port), **DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING**, it may bring you potential security risk and performance problems. Henceforth, you'd better upgrade Django built-in server to a stronger one, such as [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/).

#### With Gunicorn (pure Python)
1. install [Gunicorn](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/gunicorn/): ``pip3 install gunicorn``
2. run your server (with multi threads support): ``gunicorn XCloud.wsgi -b YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001 --threads THREADS_NUM --timeout=200``
3. open your browser and visit welcome page: ```http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001/index```

#### With uWSGI (pure C)
1. install [uWSGI](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/uwsgi/): ``pip3 install uwsgi``. Try ``conda install -c conda-forge uwsgi`` if you prefer [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. start your uWSGI server: ``uwsgi --http :8001 --chdir /data/lucasxu/Projects/XCloud -w XCloud.wsgi``
3. you can specify more configuration in [uwsgi.ini](./uwsgi.ini), and start uWSGI by: ``uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini``
4. open your browser and visit welcome page: ```http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001/index```


#### With Nginx
**Note**: [this tutorial](https://uwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html) gives more details about Nginx and Django

1. install Nginx: ``sudo apt-get install nginx``
2. install uwsgi: ``sudo pip3 install uwsgi``
3. start Nginx: ``sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start``. Type ``ps -ef |grep -i nginx`` to see whether Nginx has started successfully
4. open your browser and visit ``YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:80``, if you see nginx welcome page, then you have installed Nginx successfully
5. restart Nginx: ``sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart``
6. config your Nginx: ``sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`` as follows:
   ```
   user  nginx;
   worker_processes  1;

   error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
   pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;


   events {
       use   epoll;
       worker_connections  1024;
   }


   http {
       include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
       default_type  application/octet-stream;

       log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                         '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                         '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

       access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

       sendfile        on;
       #tcp_nopush     on;

       keepalive_timeout  65;

       gzip  on;

       include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
       upstream backend {
           server YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001;
           server YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8002;
           server YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8003;
           server YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8004;
       }

       server {
           listen 8008;
           server_name YOUR_MACHINE_IP;
           access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
           charset  utf-8;
           gzip on;
           gzip_types text/plain application/x-javascript text/css text/javascript application/x-httpd-php application/json text/json image/jpeg image/gif image/png application/octet-stream;

           # set project uwsgi path
           location /cv/ {
               include uwsgi_params;  # import an Nginx module to communicate with uWSGI
               uwsgi_connect_timeout 30;
               uwsgi_pass unix:/opt/project_teacher/script/uwsgi.sock;  # set uwsgi's sock file, so all dynamical requests will be sent to uwsgi_pass
               proxy_connect_timeout 300;
               proxy_buffering off;

               proxy_pass http://backend;
           }

           location /static/ {
               alias  /data/lucasxu/Projects/XCloud/cv/static/;
               index  index.html index.htm;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

> Note: suppose you start **4** deep learning services with ports from 8001 to 8004, on CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES from 0 to 3, respectively. The above configuration indicates that **all concurrent requests will be proxied to YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8008/cv/**. So it's easy to solve concurrent requests from clients.

8. restart Nginx: ``sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart``, then **enjoy it!**


#### More
In the near future, I will explore more methods in `Machine Leanring in Production` fields, and share related articles on [ML_IN_PRODUCTION.md](ML_IN_PRODUCTION.md) or [my blog](https://lucasxlu.github.io/blog/).

## Stress Testing
For stress testing, please refer to [API_STRESS_TESTING_WITH_JMETER.md](API_STRESS_TESTING_WITH_JMETER.md) for more details!
 

## API Usage
We support **3 types** of request type in API, namely, ``web form uploaded file``, ``base64 image`` and ``image URL (such as Swift)``.

* Bash
```shell 
curl -F "image=@111.jpg" YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001/cv/xxxrec
```

```shell
curl -d "image=https://xxx.com/file/test.jpg" YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001/cv/xxxrec
```

* Python
```python
import base64
import requests

req_url = 'YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8001/cv/xxxrec'
with open("/path/to/test.jpg", mode='rb') as f:
    image = base64.b64encode(f.read())
    resp = requests.post(req_url, data={
        'image': image,
    })

    print(resp.json())
```
